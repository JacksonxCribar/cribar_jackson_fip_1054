# My website project is about my love for vintage clothes

# I built a 3 page website that looks like an online vintage store

# I did a Home page, which includes a custom made logo, a self made promo image, and two featured products

# In addition I also made a "Shop" page which is meant to look like the actual shop for the store, featuring pictures of some of my clothes that I own

# And finally I added a Contact Us page for some contact info
