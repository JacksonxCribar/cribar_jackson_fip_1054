## What's This about?
1. My Website is about my love for Vintage Clothes
2. I built a 3 page website that looks like an online vintage store
3. I made a homepage which includes a custom made logo, a self made promo image, and two featured products
4. I also made a shop page that is meant to look like the actual shop for the store, featuring some of the clothes I own
5. And finally I made a contact with contact info
